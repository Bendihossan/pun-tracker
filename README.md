Pun Tracker
==========

Pun Tracker is an attempt to provide different implementations of the same application

Like TodoMVC but for server side languages

Concept
=======

The Pun Tracker application should stay minimalistic but cover enough piece of a backend stack.
Such as:

- A core language
- Access to a database
- View rendering via templates
- Forms with dates and some validation
- File uploading
- In general, any user interaction should access the server

- Unit tests
- And functionals?

- Authentication?

The Application
===============

Pun Tracker can contain three pages:

- The index page should display Puns, let users delete them and vote for their favourite
- A page that let you submit Puns. A simple text ond an image.
- A page that let you create a __User__ (Or modify your profile) 

Current examples
================

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Language</th><th>Framework</th><th>Database</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scala</td><td>Play 2</td><td>H2 In Memory</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ideas
=====

Same thing for API and command line tools
