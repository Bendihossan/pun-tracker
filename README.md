Pun Tracker
==========

Pun Tracker is an attempt to provide different implementations of the same application

Like TodoMVC but for server side languages

Concept
=======

The Pun Tracker application should stay minimalistic but cover enough piece of a backend stack.
Such as:

- A core language
- Access to a database
- View rendering via template
- File uploading
- User interaction with server access

- Authentication?

The Application
===============

Pun Tracker can contain three pages:

- A page that let you create a __User__ (Or modify your profile) 
- A page that let you submit Puns. Could be text or images.
- The index page should display Puns and let users vote for their favourite

Ideas
=====

Same thing for API and command line tools
